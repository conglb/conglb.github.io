Đừng bao giờ miêu ra một đối tượng trong graph hay chart rằng chúng coming first, second hoặc last.
Bởi vì cảm giác như là bạn đang miêu tả một cuộc thi.

Ví dụ, không nên viết:
* Theme parks were first.
* Theme parks came first, and museums were in second place.
* In last place were wildlife parks and zoos.

Hãy viết:
* Theme parks were the most popular type of tourist attration.
* Theme parks attracted the highest proportion of visitors, and museums were the second most visited attraction.
* Wildlife parks and zoos were the least popular of the four types of tourist attraction.
