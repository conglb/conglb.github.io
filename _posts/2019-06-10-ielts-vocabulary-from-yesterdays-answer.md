Here's a list of some good phrases that I used in yesterday's sample speaking answer. Notice that some of the phrases are perfect for the speaking test, but a little too informal for a written essay.

Dưới đây là danh sách phrases tốt khi dùng trong phần thi nói, nhưng không được formal trong văn viết.

experience poor service: trải nghiệm dịch vụ tồi
have a bite to eat (informal): 
come across something (meaning 'find by chance')
book in advance: 
as soon as we walked through the door
things started to go wrong (informal)
not at all impressed with
the attitude of the staff: thái độ của nhân viên
