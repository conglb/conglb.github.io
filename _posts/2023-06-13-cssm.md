# Introduction
The former method, namely state space model(SSM), is conventionally used for models with explicit and limited number of states. For reasoning in more intricate enviroments, the authors come up with a new varient of SSM, named it as computational state space model. 
Basically, it shares major similar with SSM, but adding a computational method to compute transitions.
