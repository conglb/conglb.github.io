According to statistics, 57% of all those ages 65 and older are female. By age 85, 67% of them are women.
So, why men die earlier then women:
1. risky jobs: military combat, firefighting...
2. heart disease
3. bigger body
4. commit suicide more often than women
5. be less socially connnected
6. avoid doctors
7. brain: the frontal lobe of the brain - the part that controls judgment and consideration of an action's consequences develops more slowly in boys and young men, so that more accidents and violence.
