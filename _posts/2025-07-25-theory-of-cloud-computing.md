## What is Cloud? What is Cloud Computing?

Accordingly NIST, The cloud computing in short is: 
```
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convennient, on-demand networks access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (.e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services). These resources can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. 
```

Cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics (Rapid elasticity, on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, measured services), three service models (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS), and four deployment models (private, community, public, hybrid).


#### Case studies
